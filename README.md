MACROS RECRUITMENT TO BACTERIA


This repository holds two ImageJ macros written by Ana Teresa López Jiménez in Serge Mostowy's lab (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). These macros were used to analyse the recruitment of ubiquitin and septins on S. flexneri bacterial surface as presented in the article:

Septins and K63 chains form separate bacterial microdomains during autophagy of entrapped Shigella. Damián Lobato-Márquez, José Javier Conesa, Ana Teresa López-Jiménez, Michael E. Divine, Jonathan N. Pruneda and Serge Mostowy. Journal of Cell Science (2023) https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.261139 

The ImageJ macros "Draw elipse" and "Flatten_bacterial_contours" should be used sequentially.

Briefly, the ImageJ macro "Draw_elipse" is used to analyse the recruitment of host factors to a bacterial surface. It fits a binary mask (corresponding to the bacteria plus host factors to analyse) to an elipse. Then,it finds the intersection of the max axis of the elipse and the reduced contour of the mask and saves it as ROI sets. The ImageJ macro "Flatten_bacterial_contours" is used to linearise the bacterial contour on a MAX projection with 4 channels. It uses the ROI set generated by the macro "Draw elipse", which needs to be open. The ROI set used should contain the two intersection points identified with the macro draw_elipse and then the reduced contour also obtained with the macro draw_elipse.
